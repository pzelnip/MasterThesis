\section{Outline of an experiment for evaluating the effectiveness of the Gem Cutter}

In Chapter \ref{chapter:Exp} we explored a qualitative evaluation of the Gem Cutter with a bias towards a pedagogical viewpoint.  However, a useful compliment to this would be to explore a more \emph{quantitative} evaluation of the environment.  In this section we will outline an experiment which could provide a meaningful empirical evaluation of the Gem Cutter.

\cite{Kelso02} outlined an experiment for his VFPE in which he outlined two possible avenues of for empirical evaluation of the VFPE:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evaluating the general adequacy of the environment
	\item Investigating Visual Programming proper
\end{enumerate}

The first is focused on conducting experiments to evaluate the general adequacy of the programming environment.  Such experiments would focus on showing quantitatively that for programmers experienced with textual languages, that the visual environment is not significantly worse than the textual alternative.  That is, that the environment is ``feature-equivalent'' to a given textual environment.

The second is for the purpose of exploring the textual/visual division.  That is, experiments designed here would be for the purpose of identifying differences that are due solely to the respective modes of display and the programming environment tools.  This was the type of experiment that Kelso outlined for his VFPE.  This requires a textual environment which is roughly equivalent to the VFPE.  
Given that the VFPE from a semantics and abstract syntax viewpoint is very similar to Haskell, Kelso believed that an experiment comparing the two would reveal differences between the visual and textual forms of representation.  Given that the Gem Cutter truly is the visual representation of CAL code, it would seem that an experiment of this form with the Gem Cutter and CAL would be more telling of the differences between the visual and the textual.

In addition to these, we can foresee other avenues for empirical evaluation of the Gem Cutter, most notably that of the functional versus object-orientation.  There have already been studies which have explored the differences between functional programming and object-orientated programing (FIXME - references??), but they have all been based solely in the textual world.  Similar experiments using the Gem Cutter (a visual environment rooted in the functional paradigm) and one of the common object-orientated environments (such as Prograph, Alice, or Scratch) would be an interesting addition to the work exploring the difference between the two paradigms.

For our purposes as educators however, we are more interested about how effective the Gem Cutter can be as a learning tool for students.  As such, we shall identify an experiment which explores two other avenues of exploration.  The first is to assess if the Gem Cutter can meet a typical set of learning objectives (ie - ``Does the student learn the concept?''), and the second assesses the transfer of skill to another environment (ie - ``Can the student apply what he/she learned to a different language?'').
