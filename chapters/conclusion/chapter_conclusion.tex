\section{Future Work}

Here's where I talk about all the stuff I should have done but didn't do. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Larger, more comprehensive user studies, or user studies which focus on different FP concepts
\item Other HCI based evaluation strategies other than the cognitive dimensions framework.  Green talks about how others can be complementary to his CD framework.
\item An evaluation of whether or not people who start with Gem Cutter have difficulty transitioning to a textual language
\item \cite{brown08} talks about how an inherent flaw in Alice is that Alice has very visual abstractions and objects, and 
when students jump to Java they struggle with now having to make those abstractions work in their heads.  An interesting question
would be to explore if Gem Cutter has the same drawback given that unlike Alice where it is purely used for creating visual
``stories'', it is a full programming environment, and while abstractions have a visual representation (all functions are 
triangular gems on a tabletop), it is much more abstract than seeing a bunny hop across the screen
\end{itemize}
